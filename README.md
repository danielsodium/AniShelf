# Anishelf

Anishelf is an electron application that downloads anime episodes. I couldn't find any pre-existing anime downloader that had a clean UI, so I decided to create my own. This was my first project using electron.js. It scrapes episodes from allanime.

I do not take responsibility for what you use this application for. I created this for the purpose of learning electron.js. I kind of also only update this if I'm going on a trip and need to download anime to watch on the way.
